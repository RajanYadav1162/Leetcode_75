/*
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * 
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
 * index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
 * peaks.
 * 
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
 * always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
 * array.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
 * number 2.
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
 * element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

//Solution
/*
 * A bit tricky but understandable.
   1. Think of a point like, lets say we are at 1th index(at 5) [4, 5, 6....], we know that the very next index element is greater then 5
      so, we should try searching for peak in right half of the array. why?
       1. from 6 whether we get increasing elements or may be somewhere get one decreased element.(draw mountain diagram)
          both of these cases will produce a peak element.
